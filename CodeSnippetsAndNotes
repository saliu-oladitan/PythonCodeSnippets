<--1----RESOLE ERROR: Import "django.urls" could not be resolved from sourcePylance...>>>
This error can show up when you are trying to work on your Django App in Visual Studio or another editor.
1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system, you have Django installed in the right directory and you have "python interpreter" in your editor (e.g. VS Code)
2. Make sure you open the folder that holds your Django app and virtual environment (if you have installed your venv in a folder) and not the one that holds only your Django app

It's a PL (Python Library)
The Python Imaging Library adds image processing capabilities to your Python interpreter.

This library provides extensive file format support, an efficient internal representation, and fairly powerful image processing capabilities.

The core image library is designed for fast access to data stored in a few basic pixel formats. It should provide a solid foundation for a general image processing tool.

Cross Site Request Forgery protection
The CSRF middleware and template tag provides easy-to-use protection against Cross Site Request Forgeries. This type of attack occurs when a malicious website contains a link, a form button or some JavaScript that is intended to perform some action on your website, using the credentials of a logged-in user who visits the malicious site in their browser. A related type of attack, ‘login CSRF’, where an attacking site tricks a user’s browser into logging into a site with someone else’s credentials, is also covered.

The first defense against CSRF attacks is to ensure that GET requests (and other ‘safe’ methods, as defined by RFC 7231#section-4.2.1) are side effect free. Requests via ‘unsafe’ methods, such as POST, PUT, and DELETE, can then be protected by following the steps on: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/csrf/

#Error: [WinError 10013] An attempt was made to access a socket in a way forbidden by its access permissions

SOlution: Try to run the server at a different port instead of the default (8000):
E.g.
python manage.py runserver 127.0.0.1:7000

This is because an App might have been hosted in that port like my own case. Also, it is good you have admin right
